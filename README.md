## Summary

The goal of this test is to make you code a small ReactJS app. We have prepared a skeleton app for you, but you can change whatever you want.

You can get the list of the cities with XHR call `GET /cities.json` (the file is store in `public` directory)

Only to 2 requirements for this test, use `React-Leaflet` (https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet) for the map, and Styled Components (https://styled-components.com) for all styling stuff.
